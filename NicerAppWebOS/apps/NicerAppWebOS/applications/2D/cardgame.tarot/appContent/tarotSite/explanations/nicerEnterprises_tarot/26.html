<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 5 of Wands represents competition. The 5 is the second assignment number, and therefore a difficult card. 5 combined with the Wand's element fire challenges you. You'll have to fight hard for your idea, but you stand a good chance of succeeding.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Overcome your fears of rejection and failure. Fight for the realisation of your dreams. Don't be afraid to confront yourself either, so you can discover what you're worth. This card is more about the fighting than the winning.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
An important wish of yours is getting closer to being realized. This may scare you somewhat, because in your dreams you were able to make it as beautiful as you want, while reality doesn't always give you exactly what you want.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Now is not the time to fight, now is the time to evade. Choose a safe way to come closer to realisation of your dreams and ideas.
