<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The card of The Tower goes by different names in different Tarot games. Some call it The Tower of Destruction, or The House of God, or Tower of the Light.<br/>
Some think that The Tower gives reference to the tower of Bable, but there are no direct indications for this.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
The Tower has the number 16 attached to it, composed that is 7. This is a ladder number, a number of ambition and climbing to new heights.<br/>
The composed number of this card is the same as The Chariot's, but where The Chariot represents balance, The Tower represents chaos.<br/>
You've come a long way in the cycle already. You've let go of the old to welcome the new, you've faced and overcome your fears, yet The Tower tears down whatever remains.<br/>
This card lets chaos loose into your life, so that creativity and growth can flourish. The Tower ends what The Hanged Man started. From here the journey back to the upperworld begins.
