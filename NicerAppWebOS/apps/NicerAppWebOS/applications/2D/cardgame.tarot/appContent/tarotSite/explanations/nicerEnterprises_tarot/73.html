<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 10 of Pentacles represents material posessions. The number 10 of Pentacles forms the links to the Ace (first card) of Wands (the first suit in the minor Arcana), and thus prepares to bring you back to the beginning of the minor Arcana, ready for a next cycle through the tarot.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Let your recent work or success increase your self-esteem and self-confidence, but not so much that you become arrogant or lazy.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
Success has smiled upon you recently, and you radiate it at least somewhat to the world around you, where some other people might notice on your self-confidence and get interested by it and what you're doing to get in such a state. These people might in turn be willing and able to help you further along your path to your ideal.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
What you're doing and what you've achieved can sometimes actually sneekingly become a hinderance to you, because you cling to those achievements and think you've completed your ideal, while in reality you're not completely there yet. So don't become lazy, take the relexation that your previous achievements bring and combine it with alertness to make the next steps to fulfillment of your ideal.
