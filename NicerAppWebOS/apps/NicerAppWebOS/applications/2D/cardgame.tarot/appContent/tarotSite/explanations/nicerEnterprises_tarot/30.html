<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 9 represents rest after work, which is another thing (like 8) that the element Fire associated with Wands is not very comfortable with. Fire likes to keep going. This rest will probably be spent thinking about what to do next along the course to completion.

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You've completed a chapter in which you faced yourself. Your success has given you confidence, and now would be good time to get a little rest, but you're probably too impatient to truely do nothing.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>

There might be things on your horizon that you did not face before. Now is not the time to be arrogant or careless.
