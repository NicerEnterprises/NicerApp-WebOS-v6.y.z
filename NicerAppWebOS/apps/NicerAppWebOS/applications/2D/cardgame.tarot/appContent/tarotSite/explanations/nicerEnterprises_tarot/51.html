<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">2 of Swords</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 2 is an assignment number in tarot, and in this case of the 2 of Swords, it's about being forced to wait for something, often even while blindfolded in some sense.<br/>
Swords don't like to be in uncertainty, yet they will have to face it here.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Try to have some fun with other activities while you have to wait. No sense getting depressed over having to wait a bit.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You've started something, and now you have to wait for the results to show themselves. Until they arrive you will face some pressure.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Either it's not the time to wait around right now (if there's an action card elsewhere in your reading), or it's not a time to get nervous about having to wait for results that will prove to be advantagious for you (when a positive and relaxed card opposites this one)
</p>
