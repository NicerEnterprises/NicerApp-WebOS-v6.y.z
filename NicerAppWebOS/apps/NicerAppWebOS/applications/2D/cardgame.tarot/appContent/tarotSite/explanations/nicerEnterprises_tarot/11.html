<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Justice</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Justice is an important concept in nearly every culture and religion. It is part of the four midieval values, the other three are: strength, temperance and carefulness. Only carefulness is missing from the major arcana, nobody really knows why.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
This card carries the number 11. In the Rider-Waite deck, Strength and Justice have swapped places because Waite saw links with the astrological signs Leo and Libra.<br/>
Consisting of two 1's, it has both the characteristics of 1 and 2. A number full of opposites therefore. The number 11 is the first assignment number in the new cycle.

 <p>
Waiting for another can be very frustrating. See what you can do on your own. Make your own analysis, subject yourself to your own objective judgement. Then the judgement of the other(s) won't a surprise to you anymore.

<p>
When the Justice card is drawn, you will feel a major change heading your way, which brings some apprehension or excitement on your part along with it. An outside entity could have to pass judgement on you, which will leave you feeling somewhat powerless.

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Don't wait for the judgement of others. You'll be able to continue on your own.
