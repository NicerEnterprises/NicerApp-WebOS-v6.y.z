<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">The Hanged Man</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Inclusion of The Hanged Man in the Tarot could mean that Tarot has it's origins in Scandinavian mythology.<br/>
In the Edda is described how Odin hung himself upside down from the Yggdrasil, the tree of transformation, for nine days and nights, to better understand the runes.<br/>
This card can therefore be seen as a link to rune laying, another yet somewhat more mysterious divination tool.<br/>
But these observations can not serve as proof for Scandinavian origins for the Tarot.<br/>
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
This card has the number 12 attached to it, the composed value of which is 3 (an output number).<br/>
The year has 12 months, and therefore this card can be seen having a reference to the passing of time.<br/>
The Hanged Man is the first (composed) 3 in the second major cycle.<br/>
First you learned that you're not a plaything of fate, that you can make your own choices. Then you've learned how to fend for yourself and face yourself. Now, at The Hanged Man, you can learn to let go. You no longer have to cling to old values. You've found strength in yourself and by letting go, you allow growth.<br/>
This is the reward of the first output number (3) of the second cycle. The numbers 10, 11 and 12 may be seen as the gateway to the underworld. From 13, here, this underworld is truely entered.

Allow things to happen to you, don't resist them. Follow your feelings and discard practical objections for a while. You're on the eve of a major transformation in your life.

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
When this card is drawn, you've reached a point of giving up your resistance to change. You allow fate to take over for a while, and things to happen to you. You've got enough self-confidence to realise you'll make the right choice for yourself in whatever circumstances.

Keep your feet on the ground and don't jump into any adventure right now.
