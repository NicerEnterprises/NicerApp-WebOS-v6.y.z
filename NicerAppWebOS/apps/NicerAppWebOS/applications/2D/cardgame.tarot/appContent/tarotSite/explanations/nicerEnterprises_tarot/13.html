<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Death</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
This is about psychological death (or: transformation), not physical death as we have to face in life. 
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
Death carries the number 13, which is considered the unlucky number not now but throughout history as well.
It's composed number is 4, the number of structure and order. 
</p>
 
<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
 <p>
Get rid of the old (habits) and get ready to welcome in the new. Don't look back too often, which may make you second guess your decisision.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You're in a period of your life where you've decided to radically clean up your act. Actually you've made the decision at The Hanged Man, the previous card in the deck, and now at Death you're ready to fill in the blanks of that change. The cleaning up concerns things that you know have to change. You get rid of things that no longer matter and will become blockages when you continue with them. But the new is not here yet, so while you cut old habits out of your life you may end up waiting for the input of the new. This may cause feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability.<br/>
Death is a card that does not fall frequently, it is a bit of a special card. When it does fall, you should spend time to understand it's meaning for you then and there. First of all to take away the negative appearance of the card, second because the card signifies an important time in the life of the asker.<br/>
<br/>
The card may indicate relational problems. Getting rid of the old may mean abandoning someone you once loved.<br/>
<br/>
There is the chance that you may want to kick out the old (habits) too soon, just to get clarity. Or you may end up in limbo, having eliminated the old but also not welcoming of whatever new is heading your way.

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Don't make any (drastic) changes yet, give things time instead.
