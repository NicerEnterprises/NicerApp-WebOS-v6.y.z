<p>
The Empress carries the number 3. This is the number of birth, of plenty, of harvest, of summer, of the first results. The number 3 stands for joy and fun, for creativity and fantasy, for warmth and humor.<br/>
The number 3 is a magical number; 1 is a dot, 2 a line but 3 the first number that generates space. The triangle and pyramid have positive and magical qualities. Add the numer 1 (male) to the number 2 (female) and you get 3 : the child. In many old cultures the number 3 was a holy number, generating balance and harmony.<br/>
