<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">2 of Wands</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 2 of Wands represents the research and digestion of a new idea. The number of this card and it's element are somewhat in conflict; while the 2 is focussed inwards, the Wand's element fire is outgoing. Fire wants to steam ahead while the blackbox 2 asks for patience.
