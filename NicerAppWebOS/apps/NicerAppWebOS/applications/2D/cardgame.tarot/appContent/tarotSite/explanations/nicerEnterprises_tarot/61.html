<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The Knight of Swords lacks the naivety of the Knight of Wands, he has analyzed the terrain ahead and weighed his options there. He knows what his own nature can throw into the mix, but does not let himself be held idle by that. The activities ahead will likely include the solving of conflicts and problems on your road to your ideal.
