<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Temperance is the third of four mideaval values, and the last mideaval value in the Tarot.<br/>
According to mideaval understanding this value is about reaching the golden middle ground in a field of opposites. Not too happy, not too angry, not too sad. In everything balance has to be achieved, extremes were not appreciated.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
Temperance carries the number 14, composed that is 5.<br/>
5 is an assignment number, which indicates there's work to be done.<br/>
With Death, an important decision made with The Hanged Man was given shape by letting go of the old. Now you're in a transitionary period and this Temperance card is a place of rest during the journey through the underworld.

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
 <p>
Experiment, search for what you think will be good for you. Try everything and don't get discouraged when you don't immediately feel some gains. Know that chances don't come around every day and it's up to you to find and shape chances. You have got to work for it.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
This transitionary period has it's downsides. You may feel you're making progress one moment, then falling back the next. But in the end, you are making progress even though at times you feel you're not. You are more careful and more of an adult when making your choices. You're more flexible, because you know there may be something unexpected just around the corner. You don't fully realize yet how far you've already come.<br/>
<br/>
But be careful you don't end up in an endless quest for compromise. Draw conclusions for your experiments, because otherwise the effort might have been in vain.
</p>

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
