<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Don't be scared of discouraged by anything. You're nearly there, make the last few steps you need to completion of your project or task.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
Things have been going well up until now. You've made some progress. But just as things get interesting and near completion, you want to let go of the whole thing and perhaps focus on something else. That way you won't reap the rewards.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
You might not be as near to completion of your project or task as you have guestimated. See if there's anything you can do to speed up the process without sacrificing quality.
