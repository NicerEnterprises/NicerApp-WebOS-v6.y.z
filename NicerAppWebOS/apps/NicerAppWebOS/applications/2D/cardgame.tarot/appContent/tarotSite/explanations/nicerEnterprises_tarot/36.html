<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Ace of Cups</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The Ace of Cups represents openness to your ideals. From all the ideas that you evaluated during the walk with Wands, you now have found the one you find valuable to invest your time and energy in.<br/>
The number 1, associated with this Ace card, is the number of a fresh start with yet more new impulses coming your way. It might be compared to The Fool, the first card of the major arcana.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Enjoy this time and be open to all pleasantness coming your way. Trust that the ideal you've chosen is the right one for you.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
The last steps with Wands got a little constricting for you perhaps, but most of that burden has fallen off you now. And you're now appreciating the world around you more, it seems, also to others. This appreciation might make you attract even more pleasantness.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
It's probably wise not to be too optimistic. If this card is next to a Swords card, it's time to be more careful and critical. If this card is next to a Coins card, it means you should be more practical and not get stuck in just thinking about your dreams and ideals.
