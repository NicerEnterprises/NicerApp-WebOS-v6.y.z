<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 10 in the small arcana, any of the Wands, Cups, Swords or Coins cards, is the number that connects to the Ace of the next element.<br/>
The 10 of Wands is therefore the transition from the element Fire (associated with Wands) to the element Water, associated with Cups. As you might imagine, this not the easiest of transitions.

<p>
You're trying to do too many tasks at the same time, don't dump all of them, but reduce the number you have at hand, yes. Think carefully about which ones are best performed first, and then do those first.
