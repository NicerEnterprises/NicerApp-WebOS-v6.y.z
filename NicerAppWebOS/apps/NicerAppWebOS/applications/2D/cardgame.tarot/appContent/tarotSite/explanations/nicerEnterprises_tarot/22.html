<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Ace of Wands</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The ace of wands represents the beginning of an idea. The element fire and the number 1 give a powerful combination: enterprise and new beginnings apply to both. This is an energetic combination, which is why the card is generally considered a positive one. Spring is the season associated with this card.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Try to focus on just one or two (new) things, it would be a shame to let all this new energy be divided over so many things not much progress is made with any of them.<br/>
Once you've decided, move ahead with full force, do what you like and don't worry about a thing.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You're filled with new energy. Energy to undertake new endeavours in your life, sometimes maybe a bit too many at the same time even. Your attention could be flowing from one flower to the next, the next even more beautiful than the previous one.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
One early flower doesn't mean it's full on Spring just yet. You are probably a bit premature by taking on new things and ideas right now, you have things to work out before you move on.
