<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The Sun has been admired as God or the symbol of all life by many cultures. Without the sun there is no warmth, light or life. The Sun is seen as a very positive force.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
The Sun carries the number 19, a composed value of 1. This is the third composed 1 in the Major Arcana. It's the culmination of the 1's. The third 1 is a reward and a beginning at the same time. It also represents creative energy.<br/>
With The Sun the third and final cycle of Tarot is commenced. The first cycle was the upperworld or childphase, a place to start and gain inputs. Here you gained wisdoms, knowledge and ideas. The second cycle was the underworld or adult phase or assignments phase, the hard cycle where you had to really work for gains. This third cycle that starts at The Sun, is the phase of rewards, of enjoyment of results.

Use this period in your life. If you do nothing you end up having a good time but not much else. If you use your strengths and powers of creativity, you will end reaping rewards for a much longer time.

</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
You're too optimistic and care-free. So much that you lose track of reality somewhat.
