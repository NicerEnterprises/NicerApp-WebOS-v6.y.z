<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
This the first assignment number of the Cups suit. Unlike Wands, with the Fire element, Cups, with the water element, has a lot more patience. Water is by nature more introspective, and this second card in the Cups suit is indeed about exploring yourself. The outcome is uncertain as always, but it usually results in better acceptance of yourself.

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Now is the time to take some rest and relaxation, not the time to go on wild adventures.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You're going through a process of self-healing, and are perhaps almost unaware of that. You may feel a little tired, or confused, or wary, but along the way you will get more lenient with yourself, and give your soul the rest it needs.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
You might be pressing for reconciliation with yourself a bit too hard. The middle road is not always the right one, and confrontations (with yourself or with others) should not always be avoided.
