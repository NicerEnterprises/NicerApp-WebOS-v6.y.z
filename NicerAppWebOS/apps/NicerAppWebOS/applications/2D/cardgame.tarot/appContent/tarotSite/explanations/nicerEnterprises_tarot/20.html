<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">The Judgement</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The Judgement is a card that is near the very end of the last cycle of the major Tarot. It represents an outside source making judgement over you.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
The Judgement has the number 20 assigned to it, and therefore has a composed number 2 attached to it as well.<br/>
2's are assignemnt numbers. And assignments can even happen while in a reward cycle.<br/>
You would be wise to judge yourself on the points that the external authority might judge you. Then it's verdict will be less of a suprise to you.
</p>
 
<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Re-live your past, small piece by small piece, to see what you've accomplished and what still hurts. Take it easy though, don't ask too much of yourself during this process. Try to keep focus primarily on the positive sides of your past.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
By re-living your past, you get rid of old blockages and throw away the last burdens that are left over from your journey. Re-living the past may be painful at times, but it helps you close off the past as well.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
You run the risk of getting stuck in the past, because if you move beyond it, you'll have to face the unknown.<br/>
So don't dive into the past when the card is drawn upside down, apparently right now is not the time for it.
