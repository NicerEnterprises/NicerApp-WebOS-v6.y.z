<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The Star is a guidepost by which you can find your way, it represents hope but also unreachability.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
The Star carries the number 17, composed that is 8. This composed number is an assignment number, like 5 is. It is a nice card, but one where work is to be done as well.<br/>
After The Tower, you're in the mess chaos left behind. The Star is your compass to find your way out of these problems. You haven't lost everything, you've still got yourself.<br/>
</p>
 
<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Dare to show some vulnerability. Follow the stars and dare to hope. Try to see positive developments and pick up on them. You will re-find your ideals, try to open to them (again).
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You've lived in chaos for a while and you've accepted that chaos and might even have gotten used to chaos. Now you're challenged to step out of chaos and develop trust and confidence again. But: someone who hopes might be disappointed, so you will have to show some vulnerability, which won't be easy after the period you've just gone through. You might get hurt again.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Use your brains, don't get too naive and protect yourself.
