<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
This card has the number 7 attached to it, the "lucky number" in Western Culture. It was and is seen as a magical and holy number. But it also encourages growth.
During the prevous card, The Lovers, all the wisdom of the first cards in the deck has been processed and a choice was made for personal growth. Now it's time to do something with all this baggage, to actually travel the road. A lot has been done so far, wisdoms have been accumulated and integrated into one's personality.

 <h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
 <p>
The time to let others tell you what to do is over, you're ready to grow on your own. But remember; you'll have to work for growth, it won't just be given to you.

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You've probably gone through a time when you were growing toward something that (subconciously or not) scared you (a bit). Now you're ready to really grow toward the new, toward the exciting, and you're telling nearly everyone with enthousiasm and some naivety perhaps.<br/>
However, you run the risk of getting stuck in showboasting. You may claim all sorts of things, and then when push comes to shove you may neglect to make the necessary steps.
</p>

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Now is not the time to be reckless. Look at things objectively and don't rush into adventure.
