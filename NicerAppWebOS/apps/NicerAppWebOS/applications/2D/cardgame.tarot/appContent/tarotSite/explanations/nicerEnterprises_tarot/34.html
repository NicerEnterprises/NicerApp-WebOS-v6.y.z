<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Queens are the custodians in the game of Tarot, they are kind of introvert. They process the experiences of the Pages and Knights to come to a much better understanding of the Element associated with the suit that they are part of, paving the way for you to fulfill the role of King later.<br/>
The Queen of Wands is drawn when you (have to) become more aware of the properties of the Wands suit; vitality, optimism and enthousiasm.
