A Wheel of Fortune can indicate minor or major wins, or minor or major losses. Things can go both ways.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
With the Wheel of Fortune, the second major cycle of Tarot commences. The first cycle in the first cards of the deck was about development as a child, accumulating wisdoms and integrating them into your personality. This second cycle is about your development as an adult. It is a more demanding cycle. You'll have to see if you can face what the world throws at you.

 <h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
 <p>
Make your choice, dare to take the steps. The opportunities did not come to your doorstep randomly, and if you don't embrace them now you may regret it later.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
When the card of the Wheel of Fortune falls in a reading, you will usually be well aware of it. The card brings a new challenge which, if you accept it, will guide you out of your comfort zone to new lessons.
</p>

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Now is not the time to start a new adventure, leave everything as it is.
