<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 7 of Pentacles is about perseverance, about not giving up the work. Yet it may also make you aware that while you've started the job, you're now perhaps also quickly tired from the work.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
You've got to decide, because it doesn't feel nice to be divided between two extremes; either you enjoy the work you've done so far, or you work some more right now.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You're divided between a desire to be active, and a desire to be lazy. You want to stand still and admire your own work, yet something inside you is telling you you've done this for long enough now.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
It's not wise to be lazy at this time. Your situation likely demands that you keep on working.
