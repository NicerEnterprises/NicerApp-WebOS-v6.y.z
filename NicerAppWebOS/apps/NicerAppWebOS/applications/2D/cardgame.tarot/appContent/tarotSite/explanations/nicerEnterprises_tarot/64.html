<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Ace of Pentacles</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
With Wands, you surveyed the world for worthy goals and ideals.<br/>
With Cups, you decided on a specific (set of) ideals to pursue.<br/>
With Swords, you faced some initial problems on your road towards your chosen ideal(s).
Now in Pentacles, it's about the remainder of the work (with procedures worked out by Swords) that gets you to completion of your chosen ideal(s).<br/>
The element attached to Pentacles is Earth. And it's attributes are perseverance, taking pride in boring hard work, discipline, order.<br/>
<br/>
Pentacles are often refered to as related to money. But that's a bit of a narrow view. It's about the hard work that completes the journey to an ideal and thus give your life fulfillment.<br/>
The Ace of Pentacles has the number 1 attached to it, which is always the number of a new beginning.
