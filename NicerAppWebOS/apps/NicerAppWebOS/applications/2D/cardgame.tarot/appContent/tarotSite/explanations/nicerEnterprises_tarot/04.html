<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">The Emperor</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Like The Empress, this card indicates power. But instead of spiritual power, this card indicates materialistic, worldly power. The Emperor is sometimes compared to Mars, God of war and courage.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
The Emperor has the number 4 attached to it. This is the number of order and structure, the number of matter; with 4 things can be built and organized.<br/>
There are 4 seasons, 4 elements, 4 wind directions. The number gives stability and orginanisation and discipline and a steady strength to get done what needs to get done.<br/>
The number 1 brings the idea, the number 4 takes it on. This also means that with this number 4 things can be decided one way or another.<br/>
While the previous card, The Empress, indicates a time to relax and enjoy, with this card it is time to get things underway and for the work to commence.<br/>

 <h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
 <p>
Of all the things that are heading your way you must pick just a few or even just one to focus on. Get your goals into focus and stick to your goals. Be careful not to get distracted.

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
This card falls in a time when you're busy and facing challenges. This means there is a lot to do and a large need to organise and structure your activities.<br/>
You feel strong and full of energy, you have willpower and selfdiscipline and an ability to close yourself to distractions.
</p>

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Don't be too rigid, you can't achieve your goals with just strength, often wisdom and knowledge are needed as well.
