<p>
With the 4, the second cycle of this suit is commenced, where a choice between structure and feeling has to be made, where old securities have to be let go of to work towards a new future. But like Wands, Cups don't like structure much, they prefer to be free and dream rather than to make commitments and go for something.

To let go of securities and pursue ideals is not an easy task. Give yourself the time you need to make this step. Don't fool yourself to believe you feel fine with those old securities, something inside you desires the new and unknown. But make sure those new ideals are actually worth pursuing, before doing anything drastic.
