<h1 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Strength</h1>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Strength is the second of the four midieval values. Justice, card 11, is the first, and the third, Temperance, is card 14.
</p>

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Place in the cycle</h2>
<p>
In the Rider-Waite deck, the cards for Justice and Strenght have swapped places, because Waite saw links between the cards and the astrological signs Leo and Libra.<br/>
This card carries the number 8, and is the third and final assignment number. This assignment is no longer simple like the first two, but is all about standing upright in the real world.

 <h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
 <p>
Stand up for yourself and don't bother yourself with others' opinions of you.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
When the card of Strength falls, you will gradually discover sides of yourself that you didn't know before. First you adjusted, now you've decided to go your own way. You are no longer bothered by the opinions of others. Even if others disapprove, you will go your own way. You stand up for yourself and accept yourself as you are. You don't have to be liked as much as you needed to be.
</p>

 <h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
This card signifies a long process. When the card is drawn upside down, it usually means you're not going fast enough for real change to happen.
