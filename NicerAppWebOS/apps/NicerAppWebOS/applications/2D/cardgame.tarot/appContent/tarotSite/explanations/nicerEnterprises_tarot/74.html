<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
Pages explore and gather information about the road ahead, with an almost naive attitude. The Page of Pentacles is sometimes described as a bridge builder; Pentacles is the suit where the actual work is done, and the Page here enables those that follow to quickly cross difficult terrain.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Don't do anything reckless right now, you need to consider carefully what each likely outcome of each of your potential choices is. Consider the other forces at play in your field carefully as well.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
Either things have been fairly chaotic for you lately, or you're facing one of your more murky choices, when this card falls. If things have been chaotic, this card will bring some rest and clarity. If you're facing a difficult choice, it'll help you take the time to carefully consider your options.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
You could want security and clarity _too_ much, you know. Sometimes a bit of chaos and unclarity can be fun and exciting, while allowing you to find options you haven't considered yet.<br/>
If this card falls upside down (or, in a "negative" way), don't crave clarity and securities; embrace adventure instead.
