<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Trust your instincts and intuition, let your ideals show a bit, and don't let the scepticism of others keep you from achieving your ideals.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
You're convinced that feelings and what your heart tells you are more important than rationality and cold intellect. You radiate idealism to others, and some of them might follow you because of that.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Don't lose sight of reality, you might be too idealistic at the moment. Try to be practical.
