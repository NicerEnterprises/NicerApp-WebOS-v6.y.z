<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>
The 6 of Wands represents victory (over yourself maybe). 6 is the number that represents the rewards of hard work, which you did in card 5. When a 6 of Wands is in your game, you might be feeling a little proud with your accomplishments. But some modesty might help you shine even better.

<h2 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Meaning</h2>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Positive</h3>
<p>
Ok, show a little pride with your accomplishments. Nothing wrong with that.
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Neutral</h3>
<p>
Showing self-confidence after your recent victory, means that others might recognize your achievement as well, and grant you the kinds of vibes that will further increase your self-esteem. Be careful not to fall off the horse though!
</p>

<h3 class="nicerEnterprises_tarot_cardExplanation">Negative</h3>
<p>
Now might not be the best time to show too much pride over something that others might not think as valuable as you do.
