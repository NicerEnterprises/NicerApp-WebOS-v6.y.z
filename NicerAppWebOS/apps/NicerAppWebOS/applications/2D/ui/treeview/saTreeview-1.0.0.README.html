<h1>saTreeview-1.0.0</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The basic problem with modeling a treeview after a nested JSON datastructure is this:<br/>
How do you store the treeview-specific settings (such as which treenodes are folded open at any time) while not mangling the original JSON nested datastructure that populates the treeview in the first place?<br/>
None of the free javascript treeview components I checked out for usage in seductiveapps do this (yet, at time of creating this component).<br/>
</p>

<p>
The answer is : you store the treeview-specific settings seperately from the original datastructure, and have the javascript treeview component serve as a liason between the two datastructures (to the point of automatically saving both the original datastructure and the treeview-instance-specific settings whenever needed).
</p>

<p>
So, onto the next question : where do you store the treeview-specific settings?<br/>
In window.top, to provide not only a single point of storage for all treeview-specific settings, but to potentially let these settings be used throughout an entire site.<br/>
