<h1>Introduction : why anti-psychotics (*all of them*) are really just depressiva-drugs in disguise (to anyone who is not a violent psycho)</h1>

<h2>A brief history of my youth and how i became an actual audio-only telepath who communicates with Angels, Demons (and now, in my 40s, also with Gods).</h2>

<p>
I was born on near the end of May in 1977, in The Netherlands. My name is Rene AJM Veerman.
</p>

<p>
I've had telepathic audio contact with Demons since i was about 4 years old, after watching some scary TV about a house getting wrapped in plastic to and filled with poison gas to kill all the termites in the wood that the house was made of. My dad, initially, also found it important for some reason to mak me sleep in total darkness each night. From that night onward, a group of Demons, probably local Demons from the village where i grew up (Volendam.NL), used to bully me severely and put me in the same stinky room with bad flooring where they had doctor types stick needles in my arm. In the defense of the Demons, those needles never hurt when they were always hovering over me just before i went to sleep, and one night they said to me telepathically "ha ha, we're gonna get you again tonight".</p>

<p>
I then (telepathically) cried out to the sky (i was about 5 by then) : "Kill me now, and we'll see what God says about it!".<br/>
Then something new happened. I sensed a new group of similar typed beings fly to a point over my bedroom (which was just under the roof of my house), and they said something like : "Don't worry, we're here to protect you now. All we need you to do is use a pin to pin that doll (of some movie character) to your wall."</p>

<p>
At first, my response was "I'm not doing that, you're just like these other ones." A few resonses back and forth later, i realized that these were indeed friendly beings (that could not be seen by the human eye, at least not under normal conditions), and much later i learned that these had become my Family Guardian Angels.</p>

<p>
From that day, the scary dreams with foul smelling hospital beds disappeared from my nightly dreams, and were replaced with dreams where i could run around the house with the air just smelling a bit funny instead of stinky. No doubt thanks to my FGA-group of Angels.</p>

<p>
So to cut a long story short, i had a mostly happy childhood, although i was bullied by taller and heavier kids, and 3 kids at highschool who (as a pack of young hungry wolves) roamed the bycicle rack looking for their prey : me.<br/>
And my first job (delivering magazines around my neighborhood, which earned me good money for my age at 12-14, was cut short when a sumo-typed taller kid figured out how to block my access to the rest of my delivery route.<br/>
In the meanwhile, i did make plenty of other odd-ball real friends (i wouldn't call us nerds by the way, just deviants of various natures), and got into long distance cycling and long distance walking and at age 6 already, judo, which i was very good at. Tai-kwando didn't go so well, because in the first competition a taller kid hit me hard in the stomach, and i hadn't gone through nin-jutsu school yet, where you learn the defenses against the tai-kwando kicks.<br/>

<p>
Starting at age 14, i went to school in Monnickendam.NL, where they had an easier-to-graduate-from highschool and teachers that did not allow any bullying among teachers.<br/>
It was 5 miles away from Volendam.NL, but even in wintern, it was a nice ride, and even with the small hail we get in The Netherlands, i actually enjoyed all the rides (on pedal bike, non-electric at the time).<p>

<p>
I had several groups of human kid friends there too. First the obvious nerd of the class i was assigned to (who later became a book-keeper), because the seat next to him was available, and as a guy coming in from far-away Volendam, wearing glasses (from the long long nights of reading children's novels), that was the natural place for me to sit down at and the natural first friend to make friends with.</p>

<p>
After a few months though, he and i start to find eachother a bit boring so i move on to become friends with a kid from the farmers village next door to Monnickendam.
</p>

<p>
That worked out fine until graduation, when our paths simply split due to my choice (at 16 years of age) to go to Amsterdam for technical information technology training. Something my dad had been grooming me for since early childhood, btw. That's why i didn't go to chemistry school, for which i also had great talent. But really, one periodic table is easy compared to programming computers. And i had promised my dad, by his purchases of TRS-80, MSX-2 and then a PC 386 with extra memory, to become a computer programmer. My dad by the way, was a circuit board designer for a museum in Amsterdam, and when he saw that i as a 4 year old found the buttons on the elevator to his workshop room very cool, decided to buy me the first computer with the 'basic' computer language on it, that TRS-80.
</p>

<p>
During the MBO (Average Professional Education) Technical information technology course, where we were the first class for that school by they way, it soon became clear that the class had split into two groups : the gamers who focussed instinctively on the KISS and babysteps principles, and the advanced programmers working on huge projects (probably for some employer of theirs). Sure, we learned Autocad and Word and Excel too, but i found classes like 'religions you might find among blacks in Amsterdam' even more interesting than 'logistical operations for supermarkets'. :D</p>

<p>
Like i said earlier, i'm not an expert-professional. i'm an all-rounder. i find all sorts of topics interesting enough to read the summaries about, and remember those with at most one repeat of the read / watching of the video.</p>

<p>
At 18, i start living in Amsterdam. I do some half-pipe inline skating and long distance rollerblading to stay fit (and for the sheer fun of it), i get hooked on weed because one of my skater buddies told me at my house-warming party "now that you live in Amsterdam, you at least gotta try this shit".
