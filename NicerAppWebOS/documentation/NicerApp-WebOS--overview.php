    <h1 class="contentSectionTitle2">What is NicerApp WebOS?</h1><br/><br/><br/>

    <p>
    NicerApp WebOS is a CMS (Content Management System) and web-apps platform that embraces the latest web technologies to provide beautiful new views of your data and files, uses very few computer resources and minimal bandwidth, and avoids all complicated programming methods where-ever possible (especially in it's core code).<br/>
    Page owners and end-users can select any tiled or photo backgrounds, and even HD, 4K or 8K video backgrounds (courtesy of <a href="https://youtube.com" target="myThanksToYoutube" class="noPushState">YouTube.com</a>) to the content or apps.<br/>
    </p>

    <p><b>Theme settings</b> be selected by registered users, by hovering over the top-left part of any window and clicking on the painters palette icon that then appears.</p>

    <p>
    NicerApp WebOS is hardened against a lot of user input attacks and abuse of business logic attacks, but i cannot guarantee at the moment that i've blocked all the possible attack vectors. There are MANY of these.<br/>
