             Two ways sync with Imapsync 
=======================================================================


Questions answered in this FAQ are:

Q. Can Imapsync do a good "two ways" sync? 
   Short answer: no, not a good one. Why?


Now the questions again with their answers.

Q. Can Imapsync do a good "two ways" sync? 
   Short answer: no, not a good one. Why?

R. Imapsync can't do good two ways syncs.

A good "two ways" sync is impossible with imapsync because imapsync is
stateless.

Each time imapsync runs, it considers messages and folders as if it
were the first time it encounters them. Imapsync looks at messages,
flags, and folders as they are now, not considering what they were
before. Imapsync has no memory outside the current running sync.

So now, why a stateless behavior cannot handle well a two ways sync
between an account A and an account B?

The problem arises with deletions, messages deletions, folders
deletions, or movings, messages movings across folders, folders
movings, and also folders renamings. Deletions and moves are ambiguous
changes when combined with creations on the opposite side.
 
For example, if a message is deleted from A by a user, then imapsync
cannot know whether it is a message deleted from A that has to be
deleted in B (what the user actually did) or a missing message on A
that has to be copied from B.

But if you know the answer yourself, that missing messages on one side
A are deleted messages that have to be deleted on the other side then
run a sync with the --delete2 option from A to B.

If you know that the missing messages on A are missing messages from B
that has to be copied to A then run a sync from B to A.

If you know it's a mixed scenario, some deletions/moves on A, 
and some deletions/moves on B, but not the same, then you are in 
trouble and so you end up with a not very good "two ways" sync. 
I suggest to avoid imapsync to do deletions in that case, which is 
the default imapsync behavior.

With a two ways sync, the account user is very surprised and
disapointed when his actions (deletions, renamings, or movings) come
back: the deletions are cancelled, the renamings and movings end up
with duplicates.
